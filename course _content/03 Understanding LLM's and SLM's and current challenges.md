# Understanding LLMs / SLMs 

Let's start by understanding what a Large Language Model (LLM) is and then we can look at what a Small Language Model (SML) is.  What better way to find out than by asking ChatGPT!

### Large Language Models (LLMs) are a category of AI models
- Trained on enormous amounts of unlabeled data
- Very expensive to create
- Built on transformer neural network model ML/DL methodologies

### LLMs power a range of useful applications like chatbots and coding assistants. 

### LLMs are capable of understanding and generating natural language and other types of content to perform a wide range of tasks.

### Proprietary Models 
- OpenAI’s GPT models  
- Anthropic’s Claude models 

### Partially Open Models 
- Meta’s Llama models 
- Has some usage constraints

### Fully Open Models 
- Mistral AI’s Mistral models 
- IBM’s Granite Models




## Small Language Models (SLMs)

"Small language models (SLMs) are artificial intelligence (AI) models capable of processing, understanding and generating natural language content. As their name implies, SLMs are smaller in scale and scope than large language models (LLMs)."

Small Language Models althought they contain less information are often focused on a specific field or set of topics.  Due to their smaller nature, they can be much more efficent to work with.   The Granite model uses 97% less energy than the largest LLMs, and is designed to be small and for purpose, containing curated information. 

## Comparison of LLMs and SLMs


| Attribute | LLM | SLM | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typical Size | billions to trillions of paramaters| few million to several billion paramaters|
| Accessibility | require multiple GPUs | require less GPUs |
| Latancy | Higher | Lower |
| Sustainability |Higher Carbon Footprint| Lower Carbon Footprint|
| Typical Content | Scraped from the internet and all available sources | typically specifically curated |
| Uses | General and specific| General and specific |
